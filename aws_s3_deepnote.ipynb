[Sign Up for AWS Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/SigningUpforS3.html). \n> Make sure you **create an IAM user** and **copy the credentials (save the .csv).**\n\n2. [Create a S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)\n> Place it in a region close to you, e.g. ```eu-west-2```.\n\n#### S3 Integration with Deepnote\n\n1. Navigate to [Integration Tab](https://docs.deepnote.com/features/integrations) of Deepnote Project\n\n    > Make sure you create an IAM User and download the security credentials. See the [getting started docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/SigningUpforS3.html) if you havn't already.\n\n2. Add [Amazon S3 Integration](https://docs.deepnote.com/integrations/aws-s3).\n\n    > Use IAM User Access Key and Security Key. \n    >\n    > Make sure you have [created a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) and use that bucket's name.\n    >\n    > You can call the integration name whatever you'd like e.g. sdsacademys3\n\n3. Once connected, click ```how to use``` to get started.\n\n    > Deepnote integrates data storage services, such as S3, by simply extending them onto your project under the directory path ```/datasets``` (it can extend more than one integration). This way, you can simply interact with S3 as if it were a directory within your project. Check your S3 bucket as you go along to see the changes.\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-a23f36b7-3ffc-47b6-ac59-6bc4bec8c439","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sample Project\n> Requests CSV Data (Swimming Personal Best's from 18/19 Season), Filters 'Great British' Athletes.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00005-186795b8-db9e-47a9-a74e-5d4b4026350c"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00006-b79e5254-429a-4962-aba1-1e180d555651"},"source":"import pandas as pd\n\nurl = 'https://sportsdatasolutionsacademy.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/data/swimming_psb_data.csv'\ndf = pd.read_csv(url)\ndf = df[df['c_NOC'] == 'Great Britain'].drop_duplicates()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Upload\n","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00005-5f865dc0-b3dc-4594-99ea-0c890284c056","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00005-8f287282-f0f6-46f0-b71a-1b1d8adae67b","output_cleared":false},"source":"df.to_csv(r'/datasets/sdsacademys3/gb_swimming_psb_data.csv', index=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### List","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00007-8199d971-5f0b-48ce-9fa1-414b9fbadc96","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00008-80dc317b-9ee3-485d-9d71-8f3e24748d75","output_cleared":true},"source":"!ls /datasets/sdsacademys3","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Read","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00011-9d506825-1c88-4080-b81a-afa8333b6608"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00012-89f3326a-16be-4ad3-a55e-5977e4bd35f3","output_cleared":true},"source":"df = pd.read_csv('/datasets/sdsacademys3/gb_swimming_psb_data.csv')\n\ndf","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Delete","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00009-a8989862-6940-4bb0-9321-2be5d46ce3ae","output_cleared":false}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00010-9f38fba5-d964-40d5-bbd6-57124fcb8880","output_cleared":true},"source":"!rm /datasets/sdsacademys3/gb_swimming_psb_data.csv\n\n!ls /datasets/sdsacademys3","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.3"},"deepnote_notebook_id":"43584739-8f3d-41e2-9980-9fe121535745","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
